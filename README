#README_MKR 

## the reason behind this project is I'm doing it for class, however... after doing research for this project i realized they are fairly important, just helps better explain my thought process to the potential user. also it will help me map out my thoughts a little better so i stick with a plan



## User story:
as a person who struggles to stick to my own plans and being generally organized
I need a readme generator i can use in the CLI
when I input info into the readme generator 
it will take that info and return it to a readme file using markdown syntax
